// Here i will find the parent reducer in which i am going to combine my reducers

// redux provided a combineReducers function that combines multiple reducer into one
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';

// we import each of the sub-reducers
import matchlistReducer from './matchlistReducer';

import chatlistReducer from './chatlistReducer';
// combineReducers returns us the generated parent reducer
// we must supply an object as parameter
// with a given name given to each reducer and in value, each function reducer
// https://redux.js.org/api/combinereducers

const reducer = combineReducers({
  matchlistReducer,
  chatlistReducer,
});

export default reducer;
